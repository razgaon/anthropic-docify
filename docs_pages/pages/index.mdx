# Introduction
 
Welcome to Docify, a new way to create beautiful and effective documentation for your software.

## What is Docify?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** way to create beautiful documentation.

Documentation of software is hard. It requires much time and manual effort to create comprehensive documentation pages, and
it is an error-prone process.

With LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more and more AI developer frameworks being published every day, good documentation
will beautiful critical for developers to adopt new products. We noticed that writing good documentation is really difficult (and
often under-attended to), so we created Docify, a LLM-powered technology that uses a critique-improvement prompt chain to 
automatically revamp your docs and deploy them.

## Code
