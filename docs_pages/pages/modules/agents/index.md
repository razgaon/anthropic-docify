 Here is my attempt at rewriting the reference page on agents to address the critiques:

# Agents

Agents are a powerful paradigm in LangChain that allow you to create AI assistants that can take multiple steps to accomplish tasks. At a high level, agents use a language model to choose sequences of actions, as opposed to chains where actions are hardcoded. 

## Overview

The key idea behind agents is that a language model serves as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in what order. The language model looks at the objective, available tools, previous actions taken, and more to decide what action to take next.

Some benefits of the agent paradigm:

- Flexible, customizable reasoning through language model prompts
- Ability to take multiple steps and use different tools to accomplish tasks
- Stateful conversations when memory is integrated

## Core Components

There are several key components that make up an agent:

### Agent

The Agent class is responsible for deciding what action to take next. This is powered by:

- A language model that serves as the reasoning engine
- A prompt that provides instructions and context to the language model

The prompt is crucial for imbuing the agent with a certain personality, providing background knowledge, and invoking reasoning strategies like [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). 

LangChain provides several pre-made agent types to get started. It's common to customize the prompt to tailor the agent's behavior.

```python
from langchain.agents import OpenAIFunctionsAgent

prompt = """You are an assistant agent named Clara. Your goal is to be helpful, harmless, and honest.""" 

agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(prompt=prompt)
```

### Tools

Tools are functions the agent can call as actions. Some considerations around tools:

- Providing the right set of tools the agent needs to accomplish objectives 
- Describing what each tool does in a way the agent can understand

LangChain provides many pre-made tools - but you'll likely need to define custom tools too.

```python
from langchain.agents import tool

@tool
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
  """Summarize long text into a short summary"""
  # summarization logic here

tools = [summarize]
```

### Toolkits

Toolkits are groups of tools needed to accomplish a specific task. LangChain has many premade toolkits for objectives like web browsing, QA, and more. 

### AgentExecutor

The AgentExecutor handles actually running the agent and executing the actions it chooses. It takes care of error handling, logging, and more.

## Agent Types

LangChain provides several agent architectures. Some common ones:

- **OpenAI Functions Agent**: Works well with models like gpt-3.5-turbo that detect function calls.
- **ReAct Agent**: Uses the ReAct framework for general purpose reasoning and tool use.
- **Conversational Agent**: Useful for dialog where memory and conversation flow is important.
- **Plan and Execute Agent**: Plans using a planner LM then executes subtasks.

See the [full list](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/) for details on when to use each agent type.

## Getting Started

Here is an end-to-end example of how to create a custom agent:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import *

# Initialize language model
llm = ChatOpenAI()  

# Define tools
@tool
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
  # Summarization logic
tools = [summarize]

# Create prompt  
prompt = """You are an agent named Clara. Your goal is to be helpful.
You have access to the following tools:
{tools}
When asked a question, determine the best tool to use and how to use it."""

# Create agent
agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt)

# Create executor
executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)

# Use the agent
executor.run("Summarize this text: <text>") 
```

This shows the key steps of setting up the language model, defining tools, creating an agent and prompt, and running the executor. Refer to the [AgentExecutor](/docs/modules/agents/agent_executor) documentation for more details.

## Conclusion

Agents are a powerful paradigm in LangChain that enable you to create AI assistants capable of accomplishing multi-step tasks. Key components include the Agent, Tools, Toolkits, and AgentExecutor. LangChain provides many pre-built pieces you can customize for your use case. Refer to the documentation for more examples and implementation details.
