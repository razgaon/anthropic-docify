 Here is my attempt at improving the Plan and Execute documentation page:

# Plan and Execute Agents

Plan and execute agents accomplish objectives by first planning what steps to take, then executing those steps. This approach is inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and the [Plan-and-Solve paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091).

The planning is done by an LLM that decides on the sequence of actions needed. The execution is handled by a separate agent equipped with tools to take those actions. 

## Overview

The key components of a plan and execute agent are:

- **Planner Agent**: An LLM agent that plans the steps to accomplish the objective. Common choices are `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` or `ReactAgent`.

- **Executor Agent**: An agent equipped with tools that can execute the planned steps. `AgentExecutor` is commonly used.

- **Tools**: Functions the executor agent can invoke as actions. Need to be described in the planner prompt. 

- **Prompt**: Instructs the planner agent on the tools available and how to plan/respond.

The flow works as follows:

1. User provides an objective to the plan and execute agent

2. The planner agent generates a sequence of steps to accomplish the objective 

3. The executor agent executes the steps one by one, invoking tools as actions

4. Executor agent returns observations from actions back to the planner

5. Planner provides the next step based on the observations

6. Loop continues until the objective is met

## Customizing the Planner

The planner agent can be customized by:

- Using a different agent type like `ReactAgent`
- Modifying the prompt to change instructions and available tools
- Setting a different goal-oriented personality like "helpful assistant" 

For example:

```python
from langchain import ReactAgent

prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant whose goal is to plan steps for users. 
You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

When given an objective, respond with a numbered list of steps to accomplish it.
Make sure to use the tools effectively.

Objective: {objective}

Steps:
"""

planner = ReactAgent(llm, prompt, tools) 
```

The prompt can be further customized to the use case. The key is clearly explaining the tools and desired response format.

## Customizing the Executor

The executor agent can be customized by:

- Using a different agent like `ToolExecutor` 
- Providing different tools
- Modifying the prompt for how the agent should execute steps

For example:

```python
from langchain import ToolExecutor

prompt = """
You are an assistant for executing provided steps.
For each step, take the specified action using the tools available.
Report back the observation from that action.
Use this format:

Step: {step}
Action: {action} 
Observation: {observation}

You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Steps to execute:
{steps}
"""

executor = ToolExecutor(llm, prompt, tools)
```

The prompt defines the instructions and tools. Tools can be added/removed as needed.

## Handling Failures

To make the agents more robust:

- Monitor logs for execution failures or unclear output
- In the executor prompt, instruct the LLM to retry or ask for help on failure
- In the planner prompt, instruct the LLM to replan when executions fail

For example:

```python
executor_prompt = """
...
If the step fails or the observation is unclear, retry the step up to 2 times before asking for help.

If you still cannot execute the step, ask for the step to be replanned.
...
"""

planner_prompt = """ 
...
If the executor asks for replanning, provide an alternate sequence of steps to accomplish the objective.
...
"""
```

This allows the agents to recover from failures by retrying, then replanning if needed.

## Extending Functionality

The framework is flexible and can be extended to new domains:

- **New tools**: Add tools to interact with APIs, databases, etc. Describe them in prompts.

- **Custom objectives**: Modify planner prompts to handle new objectives like summarization, translation, etc.

- **Multi-agent planning**: Use multiple planners with different capabilities for complex objectives.

- **Human-in-the-loop**: Allow human feedback to refine plans during execution.

Some examples:

```python
# API tool 
api_client = APIClient()
api_tool = Tool("API", api_client)

# Database tool
sql_client = SQLClient()  
sql_tool = Tool("SQL", sql_client) 

# Multi-agent planning
planner1 = ReactAgent(llm1, prompt1, tools1)
planner2 = ReactAgent(llm2, prompt2, tools2)
multi_planner = MultiPlanner([planner1, planner2])

# Human feedback
human_feedback = HumanFeedback()
executor = ToolExecutorWithFeedback(llm, prompt, tools, human_feedback)
```

The key is composing the right tools, prompts, and agents for your use case. The framework provides the flexibility to customize as needed.

## Conclusion

Plan and execute agents are a powerful paradigm for accomplishing objectives by combining planning with execution. LangChain provides the key components for assembling such agents, while allowing extensive customization to new domains as needed. With the right tools, prompts and recovery mechanisms, robust agents can be built to handle a wide range of objectives.
