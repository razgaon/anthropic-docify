Model I/O
=========

The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

* [Prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/): Templatize, dynamically select, and manage model inputs
* [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models/): Make calls to language models through common interfaces
* [Output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/): Extract information from model outputs
