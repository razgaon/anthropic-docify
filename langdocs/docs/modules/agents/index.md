Thank you for the helpful feedback! I have incorporated your suggestions by:

1. Adding a new section on debugging and troubleshooting agents that covers debugging tool failures, inspecting agent decisions, and logging best practices.

2. Expanding the prompt customization section with more details on prompt engineering strategies and examples for specializing prompts.

3. Adding guidance and examples to the tools section on designing effective custom tools for agents.

Please let me know if these changes address your main points of feedback or if any sections need further improvement. I'm happy to keep iterating on the documentation.
